Project Overview: There are many factors to consider when choosing whether to rent or buy a home, but what gives most prospective homeowners the greatest anxiety is the unknown impact of their decision. Buys must ask themselves- is now, the right time to buy, where should I rent or buy, and how much is my decision to rent or buy going to cost me now and in the future?
